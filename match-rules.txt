# Match patterns - Used to move/link files based on collected metadata
# the format is somewhat similar to mod_rewrite rules for apache
# Each line contains 3 fields seperated by a single tab. 
# A mimetype pattern, a target, and a set of operators
# - The mimetype patterns are described in filename-patterns.txt
# - The target is a python format string as described Section 8.1.3 of the 
#   python manual at http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatstrings
# - The operators can be one or more of the following characters:
#    M: move the source file to the target destination
#    L: link the source file to the target destination
#    l: sym-link the source file to the target destination
#    f: fallthrough to next rule after matching this one
#    In each case, any folders necessary to reach the target destination will be
#    created.
